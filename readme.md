# Hedera SDK for C#
## Overview
This repo is an unofficial .NET implementation of the Hedera Hashgraph SDK, ported from the official Java SDK located [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-java)

The goal of this project is strict behavioral and API parity with the Java SDK, while following idiomatic .NET practices.

The project is still being developed. Refer to [DevNotes](/readme.devnotes.md) for progress, update and roadmap
