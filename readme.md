# Hedera SDK for C#
## Overview

`hedera-sdk-csharp` is a .NET implementation of the Hedera Hashgraph SDK, ported from the official Java SDK:

- Java Source:  
  https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-java  
  `sdk/src/main/java/com/hedera/hashgraph/sdk/`

- C# Port:  
  https://github.com/xyclone-designs/hedera-sdk-csharp  
  `src/Hedera.Hashgraph/SDK/`

The goal of this project is strict behavioral and API parity with the Java SDK, while following idiomatic .NET practices.

The project is still being developed. Refer to [DevNotes](https://github.com/xyclone-designs/hedera-sdk-csharp/devnotes.md) for progress, update and roadmap
